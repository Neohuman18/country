<h2>Population</h2>
<p>The Great Rift Valley is often referred to as the "cradle of humanity" because of the many hominid fossils that have been found there. The oldest, Miocene Proconsul, was discovered on the volcanic island of Rusinga by paleo-primate and archaeologist Louis Leakey. Other findings indicate that hominids such as Homo habilis and Homo ergaster lived in present-day Kenya 2.5 million years ago.

People from the northeast, speaking a Cushitic language, arrived in the coastal region around 2000 BC. In the transition from the 2nd to the 1st millennium B.C., the first Bantu people arrived from the west, the so-called "Urewe culture", named after the archaeological site in central Nyanza where it was first discovered. The arrival of other Bantu peoples continued until the end of the first millennium A.D. Finally, from 1500 A.D. onwards, the Nilotic-speaking peoples arrived from the northwest and more specifically from the Nile Valley, hence their name Nilote.
