<p>Ethiopia, a country located in the Horn of Africa, is bordered to the northeast by Eritrea and Djibouti, to the southeast by Somalia, to the southwest by Kenya, and to the west by Sudan. Ethiopia covers 1,133,380 km², the equivalent of Colombia, Bolivia or Egypt, or... twice the size of France. Its capital is Addis Ababa.
Since 1994, the new Constitution has divided the territory into eight states (or regions or provinces), formed in principle on an ethnic basis and three chartered cities (Addis Ababa, Harar and Diré-Dawa): the State of Afar , Amhara State, Beni-Shangul State, Gambella State, Southern State,</p>

<h2>Ethnic groups</h2>
<p>Ethiopia is a mosaic of more than 80 ethnic groups. The Oromo (also called Galla) are the most numerous (approx. 40%) followed by the Amhara and the Tigrayans (32%). The other numerically significant ethnic groups are the Sidamo (9%), the Ari or Shankella (6%), the Somali (6%), the Afar (4%) also called Danakil and the Gurage (2% ) <p>


<h2>language</h2>
<p>Although Amharic is a minority language (30%), it is the official and administrative language of the country. The federal government uses it as a working language. Amharic also serves as a vehicular language between the different ethnic groups in the center of the country. It is estimated that Amharic is spoken by as many speakers as a second language, which means that 60% of the population can express themselves in one way or another in this language. In the north of Ethiopia, it is the tigrina which is used as vehicular language, but it is the oromo which exerts this function in the South. In short, Amharic, Tigrina and Oromo are the three national vehicular languages ​​of Ethiopia.English is the administrative language with Amharic, but it is mainly spoken in urban centers, especially in hotels and tourist places; the average Ethiopian gabs more English than he speaks it. This is the case with Italian, still spoken by the oldest. Some people also speak Russian or Spanish, a holdover from Soviet and Cuban advisers. Finally, French is known to employees of the Ethiopian (and Djibouti) railway.
In addition, Arabic is a language taught in Koranic schools to Ethiopians of Muslim religion.</p>

<h2>Religions</h2>
<p>Nearly half of the population is of Orthodox Christian or Coptic religion . Christianity predominates in the north of the country. The Church of Ethiopia, attached to the Coptic Church of Egypt, was the State Church until 1974. Ethiopian Orthodoxy is characterized by a strong monastic tradition and, until the Marxist revolution, the clergy was present in almost every city in the country. His vision of Christian values ​​is intertwined with traditional African beliefs that incorporate spirits and demons, while religious services willingly give room to dance, astrology and divination. The distribution of beliefs partly responds to linguistic and geographical criteria. Ethiopians speaking Tigrina or Amharic are 90% Christian and those speaking Sidamo 60%.

As for Islam , it is practiced by about 40% of the population, mainly in the isolated regions of the South and the regions of the East. Islam penetrated the country during the territorial conquests of the 7th century .</p>

<h2>Electronic Media </h2>
<p>In general, the electronics sector remains under the full control of the State, despite a deregulation law adopted in 1999 (law no. 178/99).  Radio Fana , one of the few private stations in the country, serves as a propaganda tool for the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF, in power). There are a few other private stations, but they are all linked to political parties. However, under section 19 of the Federal Press and Broadcasting Law (No. 178/99), activities in the broadcasting sector in Ethiopia are strictly reserved for Ethiopian citizens and prohibited for political parties and religious organizations. .

Due to the low literacy of Ethiopians, radio is the predominant and most influential media among the public. Of course, because the Ethiopian oral tradition is important, national radio and television have often been used by the government to rally public support; they have therefore played a decisive role in promoting national solidarity, but also as an agent of disinformation.
