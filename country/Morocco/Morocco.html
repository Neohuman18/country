<h1>Moroccan cuisine !</h1>
<p>Morocco, mountainous country of western North Africa that lies directly across the Strait of Gibraltar from Spain.The traditional domain of indigenous peoples now collectively known as Berbers (self-name Imazighen; singular, Amazigh), Morocco has been subject to extensive migration and has long been the location of urban communities that were originally settled by peoples from outside the region. Controlled by Carthage from an early date, the region was later the westernmost province of the Roman Empire. Following the Arab conquest of the late 7th century CE, the broader area of North Africa came to be known as the Maghrib (Arabic: “the West”), and the majority of its people accepted Islam. Subsequent Moroccan kingdoms enjoyed political influence that extended beyond the coastal regions, and in the 11th century the first native Amazigh dynasty of North Africa, the Almoravids, gained control of an empire stretching from Andalusian (southern) Spain to parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Attempts by Europeans to establish permanent footholds in Morocco beginning in the late 15th century were largely repulsed, but the country later became the subject of Great Power politics in the 19th century. Morocco was made a French protectorate in 1912 but regained independence in 1956. Today it is the only monarchy in North Africa.</p>

<h2>Land</h2>
<p>Morocco borders Algeria to the east and southeast, Western Sahara to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. It is the only African country with coastal exposure to both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Its area—excluding the territory of Western Sahara, which Morocco controls—is slightly larger than the U.S. state of California. Two small Spanish enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, are situated on the country’s northern coast.</p>

<h2>Moroccan cuisine</h2>
<p>Moroccan cuisine (Arabic: المطبخ المغربي) is the cuisine of Morocco, fueled by interactions and exchanges with many cultures and nations over the centuries.Moroccan cuisine is usually a mix of Arab, Berber, Andalusi, and Mediterranean cuisines, with minimal European (French and Spanish) and sub-Saharan influences. Like the rest of the Maghrebi cuisine, Moroccan cuisine has more in common with Middle Eastern cuisine than with the rest of Africa.According to Moroccan chef and cuisine researcher Hossin Houari, the oldest traces of Moroccan cuisine that can still be observed today, go back to the 7th century BC.Morocco produces a large range of Mediterranean fruits and vegetables, as well as tropical products like snails. Common meats include beef, goat, mutton and lamb, which, together with chicken and seafood, serve as a base for the cuisine. Characteristic flavorings include lemon pickle, argan oil, preserved butter (smen), olive oil, and dried fruits.

The staple grains today are rice and wheat, used for bread and couscous, though until the mid-20th century, barley was an important staple, especially in the south</p>
<h2>Soils</h2>
<p>A dark clay-marl soil known as tirs, which is found on the Chaouïa, Doukkala, and Abda plains, produces good yields of wheat and barley when precipitation is sufficient and can retain enough moisture to support summer pasture. Hamri, a light reddish siliceous soil found throughout the Saïs Plain surrounding Meknès and Fès, supports productive vineyards and can also produce good cereal yields, though it has poor moisture retention. Dhess is the main soil type of the Sebou basin. A silt-rich alluvial soil, it provides the foundation for much of Morocco’s modern irrigated agriculture. Other major soil types, less suitable for agriculture, are rmel, a sandy soil found in the Mamora Forest region east of Rabat and along much of the northern coast, and haroucha, a rocky soil found throughout Morocco’s semiarid regions.</p>

<h2>Plant and animal life</h2>
<p>Outside the desert areas, the vegetation of Morocco resembles that of the Iberian Peninsula. Extensive forests are still found in the more humid mountainous areas, with cork oak, evergreen oak, and deciduous oak on the lower slopes and fir and cedar at higher elevations, particularly in the Middle Atlas. In drier mountain areas open forests of thuja, juniper, and Aleppo (Pinus halepensis) and maritime pine are common. East of Rabat is the extensive cork oak Mamora Forest. Eucalyptus, originally from Australia, was introduced by French authorities during the colonial period for reforestation. Since independence, the Moroccan government has established several large plantations of this tree surrounding the Mamora Forest. In the rugged highlands south of Essaouira, vast open forests of argan (Argania spinoza) are found. Unique to southwestern Morocco, this tree has a hard fruit that produces a prized cooking oil.</p>
